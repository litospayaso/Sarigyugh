      The village of Sarigyugh lays in a mountainous region in the North East of Armenia, against the border with Azerbaijan. It’s a picturesque town with roughly 1400 inhabitants, a kinder garden, a high school, a little supermarket and a bakery. The town used to be the centre of cultural life in the region, the traces are visible, and the stories are alive but new generations have neither the memory of it nor any perspective.

        After the independence from the Soviet Union (first Velvet Revolution) both Armenia and Azerbaijan claimed territories in the region for their newly acquired republic and did not manage to solve the conflict peacefully. The war lasted from the late ‘80s to 1994, demanded many victims on both sides and left a hostile atmosphere across the full length of the border, up until now. Although no major casualties have taken place in Sarigyugh recently, a wave of migration took many inhabitants towards Yerevan and abroad due to high unemployment rates and the lack of investments in the region, both in the ´90s and in the ´20s. The largest percentage of the government budget intended for the community barely covers basic infrastructure, clean drinking water systems and defence. Almost no investments have been done in education, culture, sports, recreation and other community structures in the past 30 years. Add to that a corrupt national and local government, an unhealthy monopolized economic landscape after the introduction of capitalism, immense migration towards the west, minimal foreign investments, unproportionate large defence budgets, limited welfare structures and you’ll begin to understand the state this country has been in for the past three decades.
