    As I see, Architecture is, in essence, the image of true life, it is an art that defines and materializes the vital
    atmosphere, where physical experiences become emotional and sensory.<br>

    I think that every time we immerse ourselves in an idea, we do not only face with the possibility of creating and
    experimenting with space but also we transform and improve society. I believe in Architecture as a whole in
    continuous development, that it is able to provide new approaches based on analysis, involvement, and knowledge, as
    essential steps to achieve true urban life; a complete experience which merges with all arts.<br>

    That is the reason why, for me, being an architect implies the passion of all the ways of expression, and I
    consider that teamwork has a relevant importance because only the variety of knowledge and the desire to learn will
    allow us to reach a complete spatial experience.<br>
